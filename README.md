## Overview
VisionAttendance aims to simplify the process of taking attendance by allowing teachers to upload a picture of their classroom. The app recognizes students in the photo and marks their attendance. Unlike other attendance apps that are often complex and disrupt the workflow, VisionAttendance is straightforward and easy to use.

## Features
- **No Sign-Up Required**: Start using the app without any registration.
- **No Setup Needed**: Use it instantly without any initial configuration.
- **Image Upload**: Upload classroom pictures to mark attendance.
- **Face Recognition**: Train the app to recognize students from pictures.
- **Unknown Students**: Automatically marks unidentified students as unknown.

## Getting Started
